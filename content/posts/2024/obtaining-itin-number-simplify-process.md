# Demystifying the ITIN Application Process

## What is an ITIN Number and Who Needs One?

An ITIN number is a tax processing number issued by the [Internal Revenue Service (IRS)](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/individual-taxpayer-identification-number) to individuals who are required to have a US tax identification number but do not have and are not eligible for a social security number. 

You may need an ITIN if you are a non-resident alien filing a tax return or claiming a tax benefit. Common examples include:

- Claiming tax treaty benefits
- Filing a return for refund purposes
- Reporting tax withholding on investment income
- Claiming dependents living abroad
- Reporting real estate transactions

[Check the IRS page](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/individual-taxpayer-identification-number) for the official guidance on ITIN eligibility.
